👋 Welcome to RanmAWS-GitCV

I’m currently 14, building toward a cloud engineering career with the goal of a valid, professional CV by 18 and financial independence before 28.

This GitHub documents my journey toward securing a remote cloud role, using a hybrid path of traditional study, focused self-teaching, and automated workflows.

    Goal: Reach financial independence early through smart, deliberate work — not burnout.

⚡ Focus Areas:

    🌩️ AWS Cloud (Boto3, Terraform, EC2, S3, IAM, and more)

    🐍 Python automation & scripting

    🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

    🎓 Self-learning path designed for early mastery

🗂️ Main Repos:

    aws-init-log – Logging my first steps into AWS

    python-scripts-ranmagennics – Practical Python tools from my learning path

    cloud-projects-101 – Deploying real infrastructure via code

🧭 Long-Term Vision:

-    🚫 No debt: fund education independently, or move straight          into apprenticeships or work experience after school

-    💻 Start at 14, build a valid portfolio and job-ready skills        by 18

-    🏞️ Prioritize deep, consistent focus over hustle culture or         job-hopping

 -   🌍 Gain long-term remote flexibility to work from anywhere

 -   ✅ Achieve peace, financial stability, and a challenging yet       fulfilling career earlier than most

    “Every commit is a step toward securing the future.”
